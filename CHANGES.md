### 31-may-2016

- Removed auto-detection of syntax by first-line -- it was hijacking all PHP and HTML files. Now it only auto-detects Twig files by file extension
- Removed superfluous `html.twig` extension matcher
- Changed name of syntax to just *Twig* (instead of *HTML Twig*)
- Replaced spaces with tabs in snippet files as per the documentation
